# hello-world
This repository is ~~a test because I have no clue how the hell to use github correctly yet~~ for practicing the GitHub Flow.

A little bit about me:
<ol>
  <li>I like designing majored in it! Leaning into the coding space to make my ideas come to life</li>
  <li>I like code and still learnin' a little bit (front-end dev)</li>
  <li>always down for a lil snack</li>
</ol>
